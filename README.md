This project also focuses to find the optimal regression model and classification model that minimizes mean squared prediction error (MSPE) and accuracy respectively. Methods of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Ridge, Lasso, Partial Least Squares (PLS), KNN and Decision Tree are used for the regression analysis. Methods of logistic, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest are applied to the classification analysis.
