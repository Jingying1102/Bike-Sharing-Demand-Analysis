# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Analysis
This is a final project of Statistical Machine Learning course @UVA. This project analyses bike rental demand of Capital bikeshare (CaBi) system. Capital bikeshare(CaBi) is a bike sharing system operating in Washington D.C. metropolitan area from September 2010. It is one of the largest bike sharing systems in the area. This dataset was provided by Hadi Fanaee Tork from website of Capital bikeshare. The goal of this project is to predict bike rental demands through weather and time informatio

# Analysis
The aim is to predict bike rental demand using accessible information (time and weather). This project also focuses to find the optimal regression model and classification model that minimizes mean squared prediction error (MSPE) and accuracy respectively.

# Data Modeling
Methods of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Ridge, Lasso, Partial Least Squares (PLS), KNN and Decision Tree are used for the regression analysis. Methods of logistic, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest are applied to the classification analysis.

# Data
